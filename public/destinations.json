        "description" : "What this small French Polynesian island may lack in size it makes up for in sheer tropical beauty. Here, you'll find picturesque beaches, lush jungles and luxurious resorts. The island's dormant volcano, Mount Otemanu, makes for a great photo-op or challenging hike, and the friendly Bora Bora locals can help you catch a glimpse of the island's best sights during an off-road excursion. To relax, head to Matira Beach for crystal-clear water and soft sand. Although a trip to Bora Bora is very expensive, most travelers say it's worth every penny."

        "description" : "A visit to the 'Lost City of the Incas' is not for the faint of heart, but it is often described as a life-changing experience (once you acclimate to the altitude). While the four-day hike along the Inca Trail is challenging, arriving at the Peruvian site during sunrise is well worth the effort, according to past travelers. If you're not up for the trek, you can also hop on a PeruRail train to the mountain base for an easier route to the top."
